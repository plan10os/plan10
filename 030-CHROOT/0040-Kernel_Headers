# Final System: Kernel Headers
# Use latest kernel version when possible
# Source: https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.1.tar.xz
# This section is done in Chroot environment

# Clean source tree
make CC=x86_64-pc-linux-musl-clang mrproper

# Extract headers
# !! The recommended make target “headers_install” cannot 
# !! be used, because it requires rsync, which is not 
# !! available in /tools. The headers are first placed in ./usr
#
# For kernels up to 5.2.x:
#make INSTALL_HDR_PATH=dest headers_install

# For kernels 5.3.x and newer:
make     CC=x86_64-pc-linux-musl-clang \
     HOSTCC=x86_64-pc-linux-musl-clang headers

# There are also some hidden files used by the kernel 
# developers and not needed by MLFS that are removed 
# from the intermediate directory.
# Kernels up to 5.2.x:
# find dest/include \( -name .install -o -name ..install.cmd \) -delete

# Kernels 5.3.x and newer:
find usr/include -name '.*' -delete

# Install Headers
# Kernel up to 5.2.x:
# cp -rv dest/include/* /usr/include

# Kernels 5.2.x and newer:
cp -rv usr/include/* /usr/include
rm -v /usr/include/Makefile
